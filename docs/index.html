        <h2>About the game</h2>
        <h4>The idea</h4>
        <p>At the begining, we had a dancepad, and of course, we played Stepmania. But we felt that the potential of the controller isn't fully exploited. So we tried to think of a game that would utilize the dancepad in a new, more complex way. What could be controlled with your feet, while stood on? Suddenly, it was clear – we will be making a magic carpet flight simulator.</p>
        <h4>The game</h4>
        <p>You are a genie. You were summoned from a bottle to fulfill a wish. To complete your task, you may only use your flying carpet. You can't die, you can't fail, you can't deny the request and you can't escape, since all your world is just the inside of another bottle. Only after you grant the summoner his wish, you are free to leave, to a bigger world in a bigger bottle. There is no hurry then, you may as well relax and enjoy the ride.</p>

        <h2>System requirements</h2>
        <h4>Platform</h4>
        <p>Windows PC with DirectX 9 compliant video card</p>
        <h4>Controller</h4>
        <div>
          Dance pad or Keyboard
          <div>
            Note that Magic Dance Dance Carpet doesn't support dance pad control directly. If you want to play the game the way it was intended, you need to use a keyboard emulation utility, for example GlovePIE or JoyToKey. GlovePIE with an appropriate configuration file is bundled with the game.

        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <h4>Dance pad</h4>left, right, up, down, Start, Select
        <h4>Keyboard</h4>left, right, up, down, Enter, Esc
